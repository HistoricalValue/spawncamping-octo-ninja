===============================================================================
=== Project topic:                                                          ===
===     Automated support for Transparent Object Proxies in Java            ===
===============================================================================

--- Background
    Most programming languages inherently and impliedly support sole and simple
assignment-to-variable and read-from-variable semantics. In almost all
general purpose programming languages, assignments express the direct "copying"
of a value (found on the right-hand-side, RHS) to a destination (denoted by the
left-hand-side, LHS). This "direct copy" is almost always a very trivial and
simple operation; it allows no complex reasoning over the assignment or reading
operation.
    There are cases, however, in which the program author would wish to wrap
the assignment and reading operations of variables with additional logic:
extra statements which are guaranteed to be executed right in place where the
usual assignment or reading operation would take place. Naturally, these series
of statements require both the LHS and the RHS of the assignment/reading
operation (op<-/->) as parameters, in order for them to be meaningful in
the given op<-/-> context.

--- Motivation
    Having an automated way of supporting this additional logic around <-/->ops
in a language, saves lot of time by producing the trivial, hustle-code that the
programmer would have to write "by-hand" in order to support it.
    This includes writing code so that instead of using plain, built-in
assignment or reading operations, the appropriate wrapper logic is invoked.
    Such wrappers can be used, for example, in Transactional Objects, which
ensure the atomicity of read and write operations on memory.

--- Problem statement
    In this project, Java-bytecode will be parsed and assignment/reading
operations will be automatically replaced with appropriate method invocations
of the Proxy object.
    Only the assign-to and read-from operations will be replaced. Every other
method invocation on the object is assumed to be handled correctly by an
overriding implementation of that method in the Proxy object.
    The supertype of all Proxy objects, as well the assign-to and read-from
methods are configurable. They, however, have to be common, among all proxy
objects.
    This replacement will be achieved by parsing a compiled java program
bytecode, making a points-to analysis, and replacing aliases of a Proxy type
with the respective read or write methods, where necessary.
    Care must be taken about where such replacements are actually necessary.
Generally, the rules to follow are:
        - replace variables which are found to be aliases of a Proxy-typed
          object,
        - replace every assignment to a proxy object with an invocation of the
          assignment method (passing the RHS as an argument, of course),
        - replace every occurence of a proxy-typed variable with an invocation
          of the read method.
    All of the above make the following assumptions: if a proxy type PrT is used
as a proxy for a type CrT, it must be the case that:
        - PrT is a subtype of CrT (CrT is substitutable by PrT),
        - PrT has the specified reading-method,
        - PrT has the specified assignment-method,
        - the reading-method's return type is CrT,
        - the assignment-method has a single parameter, being of type CrT.

--- Problem background
    This problem requires knowledge and techniques from the field of static
program analysis. Specifically, the points-to analysis will be used in order to
achieve the desired goal.
    Static program analysis is the analysis which is made on a program (in any
form) at compilation time. With static analysis, various properties of a program
can be inferred, with the most greatly widespread example being typing and type
inference. In addition to type inference (which seemingly does not describe
"how" a program executes, but this is not true), various other properties about
"how" a program executes can be inferred, such as: dead code, constant
propagation, very busy expressions, available expressions. Some even more
complex, such as "points-to" analysis, which will be used in this project, and
which can give hints about which variables might refer to the same
object/memory location.
    In addition to static analysis, this project required planning the typing
scheme enforced for the proxy objects.
